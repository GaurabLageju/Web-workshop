	<h1>HTML Tags</h1>
	<body>
		<p> This is a list of tags used in HTML language. Each tag starts with a tag opener (a less than sign) and ends with a tag closer (a greater sign). Many tags have corresponding closing tangs which is identical except for a slash after the tag opener. (For example, the TITLE tag).</p>
		<p> Some tags take parameters, called attributes. The attributes are given after a tag, separated by spaces. Certain attributes have an effect simply by their presence, others are followed by an equal sign and value. (See the Anchor tag, for example). The names of tags and attributes are not case sensitive: they may be in lower, upper, or mixed case with excalty the same meaning.(In this document they are generally represented in upper case.)</p>
		<p> Currently HTML documents are transmitted without the normal SGML framing tags, but these are included parsers will ignore them.
			<h2>Title</h2>
			<p> The title of a document is given between title tags:</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px"><<noinclude></noinclude>TITLE>...</<noinclude></noinclude>TITLE></p>

			</p>The text between the opening and closing tagsnis a title for the hypertext node. There should only be one title in any node. It should identify the content of the node in a fairly wide context, and should ideally fit on one line.</p>
			
			<p> The title is not strictly part of the text of the document, but is an attribute of the node. It may not contain anchors, paragraph marks, or highlighting, the title may be used to identify the node in a history list, to label the window displaying the node, etc. It is not normally displayed in the text of a document itself. Contrast titles with headings.

			<h2> Next ID</h2>
			<p> Obsolete: Nwxt Browser only. May be ignored. This tag takes a single attribute which is the number of the next document- wide numeric identifier to be allocated (not good SGML). Note that when modifying a document, old anchor ids should not be reused, as there are may be references stored elsewhere which point to them. This is read and generated by hypertext editors. Human writers of HTML usually use mnemonic alpha identifiers. Browsers software may ignore this tag. Example of use :</p>
			<p> NextID 27</p>
